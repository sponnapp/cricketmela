## 🚀 Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Start Both Servers
```bash
./restart-all.sh
```
Or manually:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && npm install && node index.js

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:4000

---

## 📦 Deployment

### Deploy Frontend to Cloudflare Pages
```bash
./deploy-cf-simple.sh
```

### Deploy Backend to Fly.io
```bash
cd backend && flyctl deploy --remote-only
```
Or use the script:
```bash
./deploy-backend.sh
```

### Quick Deploy & Verify (Recommended)
Deploy frontend and automatically verify production:
```bash
./quick-deploy.sh
```

### Verify Production Only
Test production without deploying:
```bash
./verify-production.sh
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Production Issues

If features work locally but not in production:

1. **Hard refresh your browser** (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
2. **Try incognito/private mode** to bypass cache
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for Cloudflare CDN propagation
4. **Check JavaScript bundle hash** changed in browser DevTools → Network tab

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Login returns 404/405 | `_redirects` file missing → re-run `./deploy-cf-simple.sh` |
| Old features still showing | Browser cache → hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) |
| Tables not sorted | CDN cache → wait 10 mins or try incognito mode |
| Blank page in production | Check browser console for errors, verify API is up |

### Detailed Troubleshooting Guide

See [PRODUCTION-TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./PRODUCTION-TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting steps.

## 💡 Betting Logic

1. User selects a team + points (10/20/50) before match starts
2. Voting closes 30 mins before match start time
3. Admin sets the winner after the match
4. Points from losers are distributed proportionally to winners (1:1 ratio)
5. Unvoted users in assigned seasons are auto-assigned as losers with minimum points (10)
6. Admin accounts are excluded from all betting/standings
